        <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
            Stance Controlled Video (SCV) = Hands Free.
            That means no remote controls and no need to touch your screen or keyboard. <br>
            Using Machine Learning to integrate Image Recognition with Video Controls allows for a Hands Free experience 
            when it comes to watching something whilst multitasking. For example: You're baking whilst watching a recipe video,
            your hands are too messy to pause the video so you have to wash them and dry them before you can simply press pause 
            so you can keep your screen clean and dry, or maybe 
            you try and do it with your nose. The SCV gets rid of all the hassle. <br> <br> 
            <h2>Image Classification Model</h2> <br>
            The Image Classification Model (ICM) has been trained to differentiate between whether or not you're
            in the webcams field of view, it'll play if you are and when it no longer detects you it'll pause.
            <br>
            This page utilises the ICM method to play/pause the background video.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Pose Detection Model</h2> <br>
            The Pose Detection Model (PDM) is trained to recognise different poses. It's much more advanced than the ICM
            and therefore a little more complex. The PDM is so advanced it can differentiate between you standing up, sitting down or crouching.
            Utilising it's advanced form of recognition would add a lot more hands free functionality, for example if it was trained to recognise 
            someone standing with their arms out as lowering the volume or holding both hands above your head as raising the volume, it would add a lot
            more freedom to multitask.
            <br><br>

            <h2>Instructions</h2> <br>
            <li>If you want the video to play, you have to be in the webcams field of view.</li> <br> 
            <li>If you want the video to pause, you need to leave the webcams field of view.</li> <br> 
            <li>When the video plays, the background will turn green, if it's paused then it turns red.</li> <br>   
            <br><br>
            <h2 style="color: red;">DISCLAIMER</h2> <br>
            <li>The Pose Detection Model isn't functioning</li> <br>
            <li>The Image Classification Model won't recognise you if the lighting is poor; stay somewhere that's well lit</li> <br>
            <li>This concept is quite fresh so it has quite a long way to go</li> <br>
